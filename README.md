For greenwich final year showcase coding skills

Work Distribution (Technical Focus)
Core Systems & Roles

Person A - Combat System & AI

Turn-based combat flow (state machine) Enemy behavior & AI decision-making Damage calculations, status effects, buffs/debuffs

Person B - Player & Progression Systems

Character stats & leveling system Inventory & equipment management Skill system & ability logic

Person C - UI & Game State Management

Battle UI (health bars, menus, skill selection) Scene transitions & state persistence (battle vs. exploration) Save/load system and data persistence

Person D - World & Exploration Systems

Overworld movement & collision detection NPC interactions & quest system Procedural or scripted level loading

Development Timeline (6 Months - Code Focused)
Month 1: Prototyping Core Mechanics

Combat flow (basic turn system) Basic UI for selecting actions in combat Simple movement and interaction system Placeholder stats and inventory setup

Months 2-3: Core System Implementation

Expand combat (skills, buffs, enemy AI) Implement leveling, equipment, and character progression Save/load system (JSON or ScriptableObjects) Scene management and UI transitions

Months 4-5: Content Integration & Refinement

Add and balance multiple enemy types Finalize UI functionality and animations Implement a quest system and side mechanics Optimize performance and debugging

Month 6: Final Testing & Deployment

Extensive playtesting and bug fixing Optimization (memory, performance, loading times) Final balancing for progression and combat Export and finalize builds

Tools & Best Practices
Source Control: GitHub/GitLab for version control (e.g., feature branches for each major system). Code Architecture: Use State Machines (for combat), ScriptableObjects (for data), and Singletons (for managers). Task Management: Trello/JIRA/Notion to track progress. Testing: Playtest each system before integration, use Unity Profiler for performance. Export and finalize builds
